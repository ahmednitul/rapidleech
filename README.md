  2DO's:
  
  @ Code audl (Auto Transload) to support multiple concurrency, by default- it should be set to 1 but able to define the amount of download requests should run concurrently, then if set more than "1" then display other status box/iframe/window one under another.
  
  @ Add another checkbox in options to "remember settings" so their last configuration will always be saved and served, so won't need to enable "server side" and "concurrent downloads" every-time.
